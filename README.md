# Professional README Generator

For this week's challenge, I built a professional READMe generator using JavaScript, the Inquirer package, and the command-line interface. This applications allows a developer to create a project README.md by answering questions prompted by the command line. Once completed the application will then take the developer's answers and create a markdown for their README without having to build one from scratch. This challenge introduced me to technologies such as node.js, npm(Node Package Manager), the inquirer package, and ES6 JavaScript syntax.

## Installation

To install this application:
- Clone the application's repository and place it into a local directory on your computer.
- Ensure that your computer has node.js installed.
- Open a command-line terminal (VS Code, Git Bash, etc.) and navigate to the directory containing the application's 'index.js'.
- In the command-line, type 'npm install' to download the application's dependencies.

## Usage

To use this application:
- When your command-line terminal is in the repository's root directory, type 'ndoe index.js' into the command-line to start the application.
- Answer each prompt that displays in the terminal. Note that the prompts require an input before proceeding to the next question.
- When all prompts are answered, a message will inform the user that the README file has been created.
- Navigate to the 'dist' directory to find your completed README.md.
